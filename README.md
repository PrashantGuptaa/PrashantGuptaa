Hi there <img src='./wavy.gif' height='20px' width='20px' />, I'm Prashant Gupta. I'm currently working as FullStack Developer in Nutanix Inc. I've around around 3 years of experience in which I've worked various technologies including Javascript, React.js, Node.js, Java Spring Boot, Python. I'm currently working on an e-commerce project.<br />
Personally, I enjoy developing games and I've developed many small/medium games like: <br />

<h5>Note: I'm not the author of any of these games. I've simply copied the functionality and developed them. Ownership for all these belongs to their respective owners/firms</h5>

<p>
I've also contributed with <a href='http://thinkcloudly.com/' target='_blank'>ThinkClouldy</a> in building various tools to enhance their business.
</p>

<p>Apart from working as a Fullstack developer, I've also mentored around 50+ students in their fullstack journey by associated with Ed-Tech Platforms namely Prepbytes (acquired by CollegeDekho) and Newton School. Here my role was to educate students on technologies like React.js, Node.js and MongoDB.
